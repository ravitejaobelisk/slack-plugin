<b>Leaving this field blank will disable webhook functionality</b>.
<br />
<br />
This is the webhook endpoint to send requests to, e.g. <i>webhook</i>, <i>slackwebhook</i>.
<br />
<br />
The webhook endpoint is mapped to the root address of your Jenkins instance and needs to be publicly accessible.
<br />
<br />
Example:<br /><br />If your Jenkins instance is <i>http://myjenkins.example.com</i> and your webhook endpoint is <i>slackwebhook</i>, you would set your Slack outgoing webhook url to:<br /><br />http://myjenkins.example.com/slackwebhook/.
<br />
<br />
Note that the trailing slash is required.
